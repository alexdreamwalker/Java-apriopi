# Java Apriori
Implementation of Apriori algorythm in Java. Part of university project for artificial intelligence course.

## Functionality

Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over transactional databases. 
It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item 
sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database. The frequent item sets determined by Apriori 
can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database: this has applications in 
domains such as market basket analysis.
